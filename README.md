# jlox: A Lox Interpreter in Java

This is my implementation of the Lox interpreter from the book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.
